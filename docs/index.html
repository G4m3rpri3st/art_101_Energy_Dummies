			<h2> Solar </h2>

				<div id="solar-intro">
					<p> Solar energy is one of the most widely available sources of renewable energies. Solar panels can be produced at low costs and purchased by people for a relatively affordable price. Additionally,  the parts used to make solar panels can later be recycled when the panel runs out of its lifespan.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="solar-economics" class="solarL1" class="expand" >
					<h3> Economics </h3>
					<p> As stated, solar is one of the most abundant and cost-efficient energy alternatives available right now. In this section, we will break down the Costs, Materials, and Land usage that goes into the manufacturing and use of solar energy. </p>

						<div id="solar-cost" class="solarL2">
							<h3> Cost </h3>
							<p>Many factors go into the cost of solar panels, but for this purpose we will specifically look at residential solar panels. As of 2021, the average cost for purchasing a 10 kW system in the United States is around $20,424. Originally, this system would cost $27,600, but the federal government mandates a 26% tax credit to all solar customers in the country. Over the past five years, the cost of solar panels has fallen by 18%, only contributing to the affordability and accesibility of this efficient and reliable clean energy source.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="solar-materials" class="solarL2">
							<h3> Materials </h3>
							<p>There are two types of solar panels; polycrystalline (lower efficiency, budget-friendly) and monocrystalline (greater efficiency, fewer panels needed). China currently stands as the lowest cost manufacturer of solar panels coming in at around $0.50 per watt, or $165 per panel (for a 330W panel) for polycrystalline panels. Each solar panel is made up of five major components; Silicon solar cells, Metal frame, Glass, 12V wires, and a bus wire. Even with some expensive parts like the glass and solar cells, solar is one of the most cost-effective green energies available today.
 							</p>
						</div>

						<div id="solar-land" class="solarL2">
							<h3> Land </h3>
							<p>The beauty of solar is that it can be installed on roofs, which means that no extra land is used up by an installation. There are some exceptions regarding permits, but our focus is on a typical residential home, where you can usually get the permits to install on your roof.
 							</p>
						</div>

				</div>

				<div id="solar-challenges" class="solarL1" class="expand">
					<h3> Challenges </h3>
					<p> The switch to solar requires a clear mindset and goal for those utilizing it: Combat climate change while saving money. With that mindset, you'd think everyone would easily jump on board with switching to solar. Here are some of the challenges that come when discussing the possibility of a switch.</p>

						<div id="solar-challenge1" class="solarL2">
							<h3> Challenge 1: Money invested elsewhere </h3>
							<p>For this example, we will be looking at a more national scale than just residential solar panels. The oil and fossil fuel industries control the money of energy sources. Political leaders has investments in this industry for the purpose of capital gain among other factors. This poses a huge threat to the future of solar panels. No further investments from the ultra-rich does not allow for the national expansion of the switch to solar. </p>
						</div>

						<div id="solar-challenge2" class="solarL2">
							<h3> Challenge 2: Politically driven misinformation </h3>
							<p>There is an agenda set up by big oil companies along with the federal government to supress the switch to clean energies. As stated in Challenge 1, oil companies and the ultra-rich control the investments of energy sources. Because of the ties political heads have with big oil companies, there have been many misguided souls who have fallen for the trap of believing everything they hear. Many false statements have been spread on the internet about clean energy, specifically solar. Myths such as: "Solar panels suck energy out of the sun, killing it faster". This is not a joke, people actually beleive this. This is all part of an agenda set up by big oil companies to distract the populus from the real threat to our pockets and our planet. </p>
						</div>

						<div id="solar-challenge3" class="solarL2">
							<h3> Challenge 3: Energy storage</h3>
							<p>Solar has one noticeable flaw, intermittent charging and the storage of excess energy. Intermittent charging is a challenge that can't be overcome without storing excess energy. In dark hours, solar panels cannot absorb any light energy from the sun, so the energy that is not used to power homes, needs to be used up or stored. Although a solution for storing energy already exists in the form of a battery, the production of a battery to store that amount of energy is costly and typically unethical or harmful to the environment in some way. Finding a way to store energy so it can be used for later is an important discussion to have for the future of solar power and clean energy in general.</p>
						</div>

				</div>

				<div id="solar-myths" class="solarL1" class="expand">
					<h3> Myths </h3>
					<p> Solar energy and its benefits have been shrouded with backlash containing myths and controversies. Here are a few of those myths and mis-information.</p>

					<div id="solar-myth1" class="solarL2">
						<h3> Myth 1: Too expensive </h3>
						<p>As stated before, solar is one of the cheapest green energies and has the federal tax credit to save money. You can also save more than you invest with solarâ€™s help to power your home.
 						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="solar-myth2" class="solarL2">
						<h3> Myth 2: Installation is complicated and maintenance is costly </h3>
						<p>Most companies take care of everything for you so you just have to pay them and everything is done for you. In terms oof the maintenance of solar panels, taking a garden hose and washing the surface of the panel to clear of dust and debris is typically all that needs to be done on a monthly basis.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="solar-myth3" class="solarL2">
						<h3> Myth 3: Unreliable </h3>
						<p>Unlike other energies, solar is a stationary system so none of the parts wear down. The materials used in the construction are accounted for when measuring up against the harmful exposure to sunlight for many years. The metal frame made from aluminum doesn't rust either, making it virtually indestructable when faced with daily weather patterns. Clouds and cold weather are also a common concern, but these factors do not drastically effect the perfomance of a solar panel.

			<h2> Wind </h2>

				<div id="wind-intro">
					<p> Wind energy is a wonderful sorce of clean energy that is supprisingly not as expensive as one would think. </p>
				</div>

				<div id="wind-economics" class="windL1" class="expand">
					<h3> Economics </h3>
					<p> Wind energy has a lot of potential to be a really good source of clean and affordable energy. These are broken down is sections of cost, materials and land usage. </p>

							<div id="wind-cost" class="windL2">
								<h3> Cost </h3>
								<p>
										 As of recently the cost of wind sourced energy per kWh has fallen between 44%-78%. Based on 2019 information the average globe-waited cost of onshore wind farms was USD $0.053/kWh while farms set in country and region areas were about between USD $0.051 and USD $0.099/kWh. Though with newer technologies the cost of wind energy is decreasing as time goes on.

								 </p>
							</div>

							<div id="wind-materials" class="windL2">
								<h3> Materials </h3>
								<p>
								The cost of construction of wind energy will vary depending on the region in which they are placed. The overall cost of construction over time has been going down as well. For instance, the average USA cost for onshore wind energy was about $1,391/kW based on 2019 research; which is about a 75% decrease since 2013. Then for most of the midwest states the average was $1,637/kW
							 </p>
							</div>

							<div id="wind-land" class="windL2">
								<h3> Land </h3>
								<p>
								 In the USA for direct land use wind turbines take up about per megawatt 3 quarters of an acre. 1.5 acres can fit 2/megawatt turbine

								 </p>
							</div>

				</div>

				<div id="wind-challenges" class="windL1" class="expand">
					<h3> Challenges </h3>
					<p> As nice as it sounds to just switch over to wind energy there are still some challenges we need to overcome and understand. </p>

					<div id="wind-challenge1" class="windL2">
						<h3> Having Better understanding of wind flow in different regions </h3>
						<p> 1: When it comes to wind energy of course it relies on wind to generate energy. Though we need to have more knowledge and understanding of how wind flows in different areas with more complicated layouts. With filling this gap in our knowledge we would be able to more accurately and productively operate larger wind power plants. </p>
					</div>

					<div id="wind-challenge2" class="windL2">
						<h3> Improving the knowledge of wind turbines and the land </h3>
						<p> 2: Once again we have a bit of a gap in our knowledge on setting up the most efficient system and dynamics of these large rotating machines. The things we need to think about are things such as the sizing, whether it could be transportable, and also the recycling of the actual material. </p>
					</div>

					<div id="wind-challenge3" class="windL2">
						<h3> Making wind power operate with grid systems </h3>
						<p> 3:It is not so simple to switch over to wind centered energy, especially because there is already a system in place. So this can be challenging in being able to create a new system that is efficient and effective. The system will need to be able to be predictable, resilient as well as reliable.  </p>
					</div>

				</div>

				<div id="wind-myths" class="windL1" class="expand">
					<h3> Myths </h3>
					<p> There are a lot of myths about wind energy. here are a few of them. </p>

					<div id="wind-myth1" class="windL2">
						<h3>  1: Wind turbines are loud </h3>
						<p> Due to new technologies this no longer is an issue as these new technologies make the noise less noise as one would think. Plus the closest a wind turbine can be to homes is about 300 meters anyways. Also compared to a blow dry that perdises 80 to 90 decibels a wind turbine creates 40 decibels, so wind turbines are actually quieter than a blow dryer.
							</p>
          </div>
					<div id="wind-myth2" class="windL2">
						<h3>  2: Wind turbines cause a danger to birds </h3>
 						<p>
 							That can cause some harm to birds.
Though wind energy farms work with wildlife groups to help prevent bird death by turning off the turbines when birds are most active.

 						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="wind-myth3" class="windL2">
						<h3>  3: Wind turbines are inconsistent and unpredictable </h3>
						<p>
							It may be true that the wind itself can be quite inconsistent, so of course you'd think that the wind turbines might be too. Well that's not the case, most wind turbines There are batteries that are able to store extra and backup wind energy. So even if there â€œisn't any'' wind there are reserves
